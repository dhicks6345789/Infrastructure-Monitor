# Infrastructure-Monitor
A Python script to monitor devices on a network.

Original code from a [project by Browolf](https://github.com/browolf/Infrastructure-Monitor).

Written to spot issues with services on a network rather than having to wait for users to report.

This code has been changed considerably from its original form. The original was a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) project, this version is modified to run using the [Web Console](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/web-console) project.
